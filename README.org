#+title: OriComp Documentation
#+auto_tangle: nil

This repository contains all documentation for every *OriComp* module. The
documentation can also be found in the repository containing the module.

Most of the documentation is auto-generated and put into this repository, but
not all of it is. If the documentation is auto-generated, there will be a comment
at the beginning of the source file explaining that it is auto-generated and where
the original version can be found.
